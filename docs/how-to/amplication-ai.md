# Amplication AI

Amplication AI is a game-changing feature that revolutionizes code generation in Amplication.

In less than four minutes, and with a few requests, you can go from an idea to fully-functional, production-ready code. This includes data models, APIs, authentication, and all the other [essential components](/getting-started/#technologies) your project needs.

Making changes to your existing services is also a breeze. You can easily change your service's architecture, add new entities, install plugins, or make any necessary adjustments, all while maintaining a high-quality codebase.

With Amplication AI (currently in Beta), you get production-ready code for all your services, no matter how many you need. The [generated code](/getting-started/view-generated-code/) is clean, follows best practices, and is ready for your developers to dive in and add the custom logic that will make your application unique.

Amplication AI opens up a world of possibilities for code generation. It empowers you to innovate and build applications faster than ever before.

At the heart of Amplication's AI capabilities is Jovu.
