# Import Prisma Schema

Amplication's **Import Prisma Schema** feature lets you use your _existing_ databases for a head start on development.

For example, if you want to build a new application or [API](/api/) using an existing database, you can import its schema to quickly generate Amplication entities, fields, and relationships, saving significant time.

Just upload your `schema.prisma` file.
Amplication will then search for models and [convert them into Amplication's internal structure](/getting-started/how-prisma-schema-is-converted-into-entities).

:::note
The **Import Prisma Schema** feature is available on Amplication's Enterprise plan.
:::

This guide walks you through how to generate a custom `schema.prisma` file from your existing database and upload it to Amplication.

## How to create and upload your `schema.prisma` file

To import your schema into Amplication, you first need to run Prisma's introspection process on your existing database.

:::tip
Always backup your database before performing any introspection or migrations.
These operations can potentially lead to data loss.
:::

### Step 1: Run the Introspection process

Introspection is a feature of Prisma that scans your entire database and generates a `schema.prisma` file.
This feature generates a data model that reflects your current database schema.

Here's a quick overview of its main functions on SQL databases:

- Map tables in the database to Prisma models 
- Map columns in the database to the fields of Prisma models
- Map indexes in the database to indexes in the Prisma schema  
- Map database constraints to attributes or type modifiers in the Prisma schema

To learn more see [Prisma's Introspection docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/introspection#what-does-introspection-do).

Here are the steps to introspect your database:

#### 1. Install Prisma

If you don't have Prisma CLI installed globally, install it:

```bash
npm install -g prisma
```

#### 2. Set the connection URL in `prisma.schema`

Next, create a `prisma.schema` file.

Now add your database's **connection URL** to the `url` parameter in the datasource block of your new `prisma.schema` file.

Here's an example:

```graphql title="prisma.schema"
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = "postgresql://janedoe:mypassword@localhost:5432/mydb?schema=sample"
}
```

The format of the `url` parameter depends on your database provider.
For example, PostgreSQL connection URLs start with `postgresql://`.

Visit the [Prisma docs' section on connection URLs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/database-reference/connection-urls) for details on constructing yours.

#### 3. Run The Prisma Introspection Command

Run the following command in the same directory as your `schema.prisma` file:

```bash
prisma db pull
```

:::caution
After generating your schema file, double check it in your code editor for errors.
Make sure you fix any errors before you upload your `schema.prisma` file into Amplication.
There are some cases where the introspection process ends with a schema that might have errors.

Visit [Prisma's Error Message Reference](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/api-reference/error-reference) to learn more about other prisma schema issues you might run into.
:::

Here's a simple example of what happens when you run the introspection process on a Postgres database:

```graphql title="prisma.schema"
model posts {
  id Int @id

  @@map("posts")
}

model User {
  user_id    Int    @id 
  first_name String

  @@map("users") 
}
```

The introspection process generated Prisma models matching the original PostgreSQL database structure.
It created a `posts` model and `user_id` field for the `User` model based on the database table and column names.

However, changes are needed for the schema to follow Prisma conventions:

- The `posts` model should be named Post for PascalCase.
- The `user_id` field needs the `@id` directive to indicate the primary key
- Any foreign key fields need `@relation` directives to define relationships

Additional conversions are also required to generate Amplication entities from the schema.
You'll learn more about that process on the **[How Prisma Schemas Are Converted Into Amplication Entities](/getting-started/how-prisma-schema-is-converted-into-entities)** page.

### Step 2: Create your initial migration

If you'd like to use Prisma Migrate with your newly introspected database, then you will have to [baseline your database](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/setup-prisma/add-to-existing-project/relational-databases/baseline-your-database-typescript-postgresql).

Prisma Migrate lets you gradually change your database schema in an organized way.
Baselining sets up migration history for a database that already has data.
It tells Prisma Migrate to assume migrations were already applied.

To baseline your database, run the following commands:

#### 1. Create a `migrations` directory in your prisma folder

First, create a `migrations` directory in side your prisma folder, and add another directory inside with your preferred name:

```bash
mkdir -p prisma/migrations/init_after_introspection
```

:::note
If you use this command make sure you are in the root of your server project.
The `-p` flag will recursively create any missing folders in the path you provide.
:::

#### 2. Generate the migration with `prisma migrate diff`

Next, run the following command to generate a `migration.sql` file.

```bash
prisma migrate diff --from-empty --to-schema-datamodel prisma/schema.prisma --script > prisma/migrations/init_after_introspection/migration.sql
```

Review the generated `migration.sql` file to ensure everything is correct.

#### 3. Run `prisma migrate`

To apply your migration for your created `migration.sql` file run the following command:

```bash
prisma migrate resolve --applied init_after_introspection
```

That will add the migration to the `_prisma_migrations` table.

### Step 3: Upload your Prisma Schema File to Amplication

Visit the _Entities_ page of your service.

![Upload Prisma Schema Button](./assets/upload-prisma-schema-button.png)

You'll now see the **Upload Prisma Schema** button in the top right corner.

Click on this button and you'll be presented a form where you can upload your `schema.prisma` file.

<!--
### Step 3.5 Optional AI-Driven Service Redesign

After uploading your `schema.prisma` file, you can utilize Amplication's new Intelligent AI Helper to break down the entities from your schema into microservices.

The AI Helper analyzes your uploaded schema and suggests an optimal microservice architecture. This process involves recommendations for efficient entity distribution and service structure optimization, all while maintaining your privacy and the integrity of your data models.

To learn more visit Break the Monolith's [documentation page](/break-the-monolith).

### Step 4: Check the conversion logs

After uploading the file, you'll see a log of what's happening while Amplication is [converting your prisma schema](/getting-started/how-prisma-schema-is-converted-into-entities) into its internal structure.  

:::note
**Schema uploads can't be redone in the same project**, so make sure that you're OK with everything you see in the conversion logs.
:::

Here's how that log might look:

![Amplication Import Prisma Schema Upload Log](./../getting-started/assets/import-prisma-schema-log.png)

These logs detail what is happening during the conversion process.

:::caution
If the `schema.prisma` file is invalid, doesn't contain entities, or one of the operations in the process receives an unexpected value â€” the process will stop immediately.
An error message will then be displayed showing you what happened.  
:::

Check the [Log Warnings](/getting-started/how-prisma-schema-is-converted-into-entities#log-warnings) section to get more detail on what these logs are about.

### Step 5: Check your new entities

After a successful upload and conversion process, you will see your newly created entities on your dashboard.
You can visualize your entities and their relationships with [Amplication's ERD view](/erd-view-for-entities).

![Amplication's Entity ERD View](./assets/amplication-erd-view.png)

### Step 6: Apply your migration

In order to apply your migration to your new Amplication service, go through the following steps:

1. [Commit your changes](/how-to/commit-changes/) to your [preferred git repository](/sync-with-github/).
2. Change the value of `DB_URL` env variable to the connection string of your database in your `.env` file.
3. Copy the migrations folder (from the previous step) from your original project and paste it to the prisma folder in your newly cloned service.
4. Run the following commands:

```bash
cd [your-server-folder]
npm i
npm run prisma:generate
npm run db:migrate-save
```

:::note
The next time you change an entity, add a relation, add an entity, etc. and you run `npm run prisma:generate` everything will be the same as with a "green field" project with Amplication, or with manual prisma schema changes.
:::

## Next Steps  

Now you have your own custom database schema uploaded into Amplication.

To learn more about the mechanisms Amplication uses to convert your schema.prisma file into Amplication's internal structure, visit the **[How Prisma Schemas Are Converted Into Amplication Entities](/getting-started/how-prisma-schema-is-converted-into-entities)** page.

You can also visit the **Prisma Custom Attributes** page to further familiarize yourself with custom attributes like `@id` and `@@map`.

Some of the transformations involve custom attributes in some way. Learning more about Prisma Custom Attributes will help you understand what's happening, but also how to effectively utilize them to add more functionality to your entities and fields.
