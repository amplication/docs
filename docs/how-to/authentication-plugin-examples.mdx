# Authentication Plugin Guide

Authentication and authorization are crucial components of your Amplication service.

By following this guide and exploring the examples, you'll be well-equipped to implement authentication and authorization in your Amplication-generated service using the authentication plugin that best suits your needs.

## Creating The Authentication Entity (Node.js)

:::note
This step is required only for Node.js services. .NET services do not require this step.
:::

If you initially created your Node.js service without authentication, you must first create and define the Authentication Entity:

1. Go to your service's Entities page.
2. Create an entity, typically named "User", to serve as your Authentication Entity.
3. In your service's settings, choose the newly created entity in the "Authentication Entity" option.

:::tip
For detailed instructions, refer to the [Authentication Entity documentation](https://docs.amplication.com/user-entity).
:::

## Adding Authentication to Your Service

Once you have an Authentication Entity set up, follow these steps to add authentication:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs groupId="frameworks" queryString="framework">
<TabItem value="nodejs" label="Node.js" default>

1. Navigate to your service's Plugins page.
2. Go to the "Authentication" category in the left sidebar.
3. Ensure you install the "NestJS Auth Module" plugin first.
4. Choose and add an Auth Provider plugin that suits your needs (e.g., Auth0, Supertokens, etc.).

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="dotnet" label=".NET">

1. Navigate to your service's Plugins page.
2. Go to the "Authentication" category in the left sidebar.
3. Choose and add an Auth Provider plugin that suits your needs (e.g., ASP.NET Core Identity).

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

After adding the required Authentication plugins:

1. [Configure your authentication settings](#authentication-plugin-configuration-settings) in the plugin options page.
2. Add authenticated users to your system.
3. [Set up roles and permissions](/configure-roles-and-permissions/) for authorization.

:::note
By default, Node.js services are created with a user with the credentials username: `admin` and password: `admin`. For .NET services, the default user credentials are username: `test@email.com` and password: `P@ssw0rd!`
:::

## Available Authentication Plugins

## Disable Authentication On Your Service

If you no longer need authentication on a specific service, you can disable it.

1. Visit your service's Plugins page and toggle the Authentication-related plugins into the off state.
2. Delete the Authentication Entity from your list of entities.
3. Re-build your project and commit your changes to your preferred git provider.

## Examples

This section provides you with in-depth examples on how to use and interact with some of the available authentication plugins.

### JWT Authentication (Node.js)

When generating an app with JWT authentication, the process includes the following two steps:

1. Send a login request to the server with username and password to get back from the server the JWT token.
2. Add an authentication header with the JWT token to every consecutive request.

Following are examples of how to log in with REST API and GraphQL API.

#### Rest API

```bash title="Rest API Curl Request Example"
curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://[server-url]/api/login' \
  -H 'accept: */*' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "admin"
}'
```

![Swagger playground for login endpoint.](./../getting-started/assets/authentication/auth-rest.png)

#### GraphQL API

```graphql
mutation {
  login(credentials: { username: "admin", password: "admin" }) {
    accessToken
  }
}
```

#### Header with JWT Included

<!-- spell-checker: disable -->

```text title="JWT Authorization Header Example"
 Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJkYXRhIjoieW91IGFyZSBzb29vb28gY29vbCB0aGF0IHlvdSBjaGVjayB0aGF0ISIsIm5hbWUiOiJPZmVrIGdhYmF5IDspIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.vaYJaP9SUlOU0u4NfFCRm5tmBVDKeCwvN6ByCkqJt8U
```

<!-- spell-checker: enable -->

### Basic Authentication (Node.js)

When using Basic HTTP authentication and sending a request to the API you must provide a Basic HTTP authentication header with the format:

Authorization: 'type' 'credentials'

where type is Basic and credentials is the Base64 encoding of a string "username:password".

```text title="Basic Authentication Example"
Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=
```

:::tip
You can use a tool to create the header. There are several generators available, such as [https://www.blitter.se/utils/basic-authentication-header-generator/](https://www.blitter.se/utils/basic-authentication-header-generator/)
