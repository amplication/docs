# Authentication Plugin Guide

Authentication and authorization are crucial components of your Amplication service. This guide will help you implement secure user authentication using Amplication's authentication plugins.

## Enable Authentication

Make sure you have an [Authentication Entity](/user-entity) set up.
Next, follow these steps to add authentication:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs groupId="frameworks" queryString="framework">
<TabItem value="nodejs" label="Node.js" default>

1. Navigate to your service's Plugins page.
2. Go to the "Authentication" category in the left sidebar.
3. Ensure you install the "NestJS Auth Module" plugin first.
4. Choose and add an Auth Provider plugin that suits your needs (e.g., Auth0, Supertokens, etc.).

:::note
By default, Node.js services are created with a user with the credentials username: `admin` and password: `admin`.
:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="dotnet" label=".NET">

1. Navigate to your service's Plugins page.
2. Go to the "Authentication" category in the left sidebar.
3. Choose and add an Auth Provider plugin that suits your needs (e.g., ASP.NET Core Identity).

:::note
For .NET services, the default user credentials are username: `test@email.com` and password: `P@ssw0rd!`
:::

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

After adding the required Authentication plugins, [configure your authentication settings](#plugin-configuration-settings) in the plugin options page.

## Disable Authentication

If you no longer need authentication on a specific service, you can disable it.

1. Visit your service's Plugins page and toggle the Authentication-related plugins into the off state.
2. Delete the [Authentication Entity](/user-entity/) from your list of entities.
3. [Re-build your project](/building-new-versions/) and commit your changes to your preferred git provider.

## Authentication Providers

Amplication supports multiple authentication providers to suit different needs:

1. [JWT Auth Provider](https://jwt.io/)
2. [Auth0 Auth Provider](https://auth0.com/)
3. [Supertokens Auth Provider](https://supertokens.com/)
4. [SAML Auth Provider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Assertion_Markup_Language)
5. Basic Auth Provider
6. [KeyCloak Auth Provider](https://www.keycloak.org/)
7. [ASP.NET Core Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/identity?view=aspnetcore-9.0&tabs=visual-studio)

### JWT Auth Provider

- Adds JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication and authorization to your service.
- Must be installed with the "NestJS Auth Module" plugin.
- For detailed configuration, visit the [JWT Auth Provider GitHub README](https://github.com/amplication/plugins/tree/master/plugins/auth-jwt).

### Auth0 Auth Provider

- Integrates Auth0 authentication and authorization into your service.
- Requires an Auth0 account and configuration of an Auth0 application.
- For setup instructions and configuration options, check the [Auth0 Auth Provider GitHub README](https://github.com/amplication/plugins/tree/master/plugins/auth-auth0).

### Supertokens Auth Provider

- Adds Supertokens authentication to your service.
- Supports various authentication recipes (e.g., email-password, passwordless, third-party).
- Requires setup of the Supertokens core service.
- For detailed configuration and usage, refer to the [Supertokens Auth Provider GitHub README](https://github.com/amplication/plugins/tree/master/plugins/auth-supertokens).

### SAML Auth Provider

- Enables SAML authentication on your service.
- Uses Passport SAML strategy and generates JWT tokens for authorization.
- For usage details, check the [SAML Auth Provider GitHub README](https://github.com/amplication/plugins/tree/master/plugins/auth-saml).

### Basic Auth Provider

- Enables a straightforward authentication scheme built into the HTTP protocol.
- Requires sending user's credentials in the form of a username and password, encoded in base64, included in the Authorization header of the request.

:::note
If you use the Basic Auth Provider plugin, your service comes with one user with the username `admin` and the password `admin` by default.
:::

### KeyCloak Auth Provider

- Integrates KeyCloak authentication and authorization into your service.
- Provides single sign-on (SSO) capabilities and support for various identity protocols.

## Examples

This section provides you with in-depth examples on how to use and interact with some of the available authentication plugins.

### JWT Authentication

When generating an app with JWT authentication, the process includes the following two steps:

1. Send a login request to the server with username and password to get back from the server the JWT token.
2. Add an authentication header with the JWT token to every consecutive request.

Following are examples of how to log in with REST API and GraphQL API.

#### Rest API

```bash title="Rest API Curl Request Example"
curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://[server-url]/api/login' \
  -H 'accept: */*' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "admin"
}'
```

![Swagger playground for login endpoint.](./../getting-started/assets/authentication/auth-rest.png)

#### GraphQL API

```graphql
mutation {
  login(credentials: { username: "admin", password: "admin" }) {
    accessToken
  }
}
```

#### Header with JWT Included

<!-- spell-checker: disable -->

```text title="JWT Authorization Header Example"
 Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJkYXRhIjoieW91IGFyZSBzb29vb28gY29vbCB0aGF0IHlvdSBjaGVjayB0aGF0ISIsIm5hbWUiOiJPZmVrIGdhYmF5IDspIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.vaYJaP9SUlOU0u4NfFCRm5tmBVDKeCwvN6ByCkqJt8U
```

<!-- spell-checker: enable -->

### Basic Authentication

When using Basic HTTP authentication and sending a request to the API you must provide a Basic HTTP authentication header with the format:

Authorization: 'type' 'credentials'

where type is Basic and credentials is the Base64 encoding of a string "username:password".

```text title="Basic Authentication Example"
Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=
```

:::tip
You can use a tool to create the header. There are several generators available, such as [https://www.blitter.se/utils/basic-authentication-header-generator/](https://www.blitter.se/utils/basic-authentication-header-generator/)
:::

## Next Steps

After you've successfully added authentication to your service, you can do the following:

1. Add authenticated users to your system.
2. [Set up roles and permissions](/configure-roles-and-permissions/) for authorization.
