# Create a message broker

## Overview

Message brokers play a key role in supporting Amplication's microservices architecture by mediating information exchange between services.

A message broker is software that mediates communication and information exchange between services. The message broker does this by translating messages between formal messaging protocols. This means that multiple services, generated by Amplication, are able to "talk" to each other.


:::info
In messaging systems, message routing is done via topics.  You must first create one or more topics in the  message broker. A service can then be configured to publish messages to a topic and other services can be configured as subscribers to the topic. When the publisher sends a message to the topic, it will be dispatched to all the services that are subscribed to that topic.
