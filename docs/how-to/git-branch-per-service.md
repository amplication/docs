# One Git Branch Per Service

With Amplication's Enterprise Plan, teams can now streamline their workflow in multi-service repositories with **dedicated git branches and PRs for each service**.
This feature enables faster delivery of changes, as only the team members responsible for a specific service need to review the associated PR.

:::note
Dedicated Git Branches are only **available for Enterprise Plan users**.
Try it during your 7-day Enterprise plan trial for new workspaces.

## Benefits

- **Isolated Reviews**: Teams can review changes specific to their services without the interference from other unrelated services.
- **Faster Deployment**: With fewer reviewers needed for each PR, changes can be approved and deployed faster.
- **Cleaner History**: Each service's changes are contained within its branch, leading to a more organized and readable git history.

## How It Works

1. **Automatic Branch Creation**: Whenever a change is made to a service in Amplication, a new branch is automatically created with the naming convention `amplication-serviceName`. If the branch already exists, changes are added to it.
2. **Pull Request Creation**: A PR is created from the `amplication-serviceName` branch to the default branch of the repository. This ensures that every service's changes are isolated and can be reviewed independently.
3. **Integration with Smart Git Sync**: This feature works seamlessly with [Smart Git Sync](/sync-with-github/), ensuring that all changes made in Amplication are reflected in the associated git repository.
