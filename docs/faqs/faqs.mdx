To know more on how to use Amplication to your advantage [Read](https://amplication.com/blog/amplication-version-10-is-now-live)

---

## What is monorepo? Does Amplication support it?

Amplication supports the monorepo model, allowing you and your team to collaborate on bigger projects.

In version control systems, a monorepo ("mono" meaning 'single' and "repo" is short for 'repository') is a software development strategy where code for many projects is stored in the same repository. Providing you the power to use the microservices approach for you services.

The monorepo model provides you with several advantages:
-Easy visibility of your services
-Code sharing among services to avoid code redundancy
-Improved collaboration
-Release management

---

## Will all my services be stored in the same or different repositories?

It depends on your requirements. If you want to store all your projects( or services) on the same repo then amplication provides you the monorepo model to do so. Alternatively, you can create different repositories to store the service as Amplication as supports the polyrepo approach.

---

## What is Microservices architecture?

Microservices (or microservices architecture) is a cloud native architectural approach in which a single application is composed of many loosely coupled and independently deployable smaller components, or services.

---

## How does the microservices architecture benefit my development?

Amplication's Microservices architecture enables you to develop services with ease and select the best tech stack for each service. Different development teams can work on different services without cross-team dependencies.

Project development becomes easier with the following functionalities:
-You can connect to a single git repo at the project level saving a lot of your time that would be spent manually connecting the services
-You can make a single commit at the project level

Learn more about the benefits [Here](https://amplication.com/blog/release-0150-support-for-microservices-architecture)

---

## How are microservices incorporated in Amplication?

Amplication supports microservices through the Project hierarchy. A Project groups together multiple resources used and created by Amplication, enabling support for multiple use cases. This simplifies the creation of connected Services, and makes it much easier to sync with GitHub across multiple Services.

---

## What is Project, Resources and Services structure in Amplication?

This structure helps you to manage various services (architected as microservices) and the resources associated with each service.

It provides a much simple and easy-to-maintain project flow with multiple services.

Read more about the Hierarchy [Here](https://docs.amplication.com/projects-resources-services/)

---

## How do I keep track of my codebase if it involves continuous development?

Amplication comes with version control built-in enabling you to see the changes made in the services and push the code, after verification, to your GitHub repository. In Amplication, your work is auto saved but not committed, thus giving you the opportunity to review.
All the pending changes are visible under 'Pending Changes', ready for you to review and commit.

Read [this](https://docs.amplication.com/how-to/commit-changes/)

---

## What is Message Broker?

Message Broker enables your microservices to communicate with each other.
A message broker is software that enables applications, systems, and services to communicate with each other and exchange information. This allows interdependent services to “talk” with one another directly, even if they were written in different languages or implemented on different platforms.
Amplication provides a plugin for Kafka Message Broker that can be installed as required.
Follow the [Instructions](https://docs.amplication.com/getting-started/getting-started/plugins/)

To create a Message Broker follow the [How to Create a Message Broker Instruction](https://docs.amplication.com/how-to/create-message-broker/)
