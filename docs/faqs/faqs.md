  You just need to define your data models, roles, and permissions, and Amplication will generate a TypeScript Node.js application with everything you need already baked in.

  <summary>Is Amplication free?</summary>
  
Amplication Community Edition (CE) is free and always will be. To ensure that we can continue to develop Amplication, our Enterprise Edition (EE) will provide additional enterprise-oriented functionality that may require payment. For more information about the CE and EE, read:

<details>
  <summary>What is the difference between the Community Edition and the Enterprise Edition?</summary>

  
  **Community Edition (CE)** – contains Amplication's core functionality. It is open-source and free to use for the whole community. The Amplication Community Edition continues to be licensed under the [Apache 2.0 license](https://github.com/amplication/amplication/blob/master/LICENSE).

  **Enterprise Edition (EE)** - adds advanced operations, security, and commercially orientated features. The Enterprise Edition is built on top of the Community Edition and the additional functionality will be supplied as source-available. While users can view and download the code, ownership of the platform code remains with Amplication, meaning users cannot resell it. Use of the Amplication Enterprise Edition is subject to the Amplication [Terms of Service](https://amplication.com/terms)
