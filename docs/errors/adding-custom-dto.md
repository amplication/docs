## Overview
Our users sometimes have use-cases where they need DTOs that are supported by Prisma but not generated by Amplication.
In these cases, the users should add their own custom DTO to the project. This article answers the question WHERE and HOW? 


## Symptoms 

For example, Prisma supports filtering on Enum values, but Amplication does not. 

## Cause
The user requires DTOs that are not generated by Amplication. 


## Resolution

Go to the entity service, to the relevant method (for example `findMany`), and drill down into your desired DTO by clicking on Prisma types.

In a generated app, inside each entity there is a base folder.
Add `dtos` folder next to the base folder and place your custom DTOs inside that folder.
