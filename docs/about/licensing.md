# Amplication's Licensing Model

Amplication offers both open-source and commercial licensing options to accommodate the needs of various users â€” from individual developers to large enterprises.

## Open Source and Enterprise Offerings

### Free Edition

- The Free Edition of Amplication includes our core functionality, based on Node.js. This edition is available under the [Apache 2.0 license](https://github.com/amplication/amplication/blob/master/LICENSE) and remains free for use on our managed service at [amplication.com](https://amplication.com).
- Developers can freely access, modify, and distribute the source code available in this edition, fostering a collaborative and open development environment.

### Enterprise Edition

- The Enterprise Edition extends the Node.js Free Edition by incorporating advanced operational and security features. This edition also introduces support for .NET applications, offering robust, scalable backend solutions.
- This premium tier is designed for businesses seeking enhanced features like advanced data handling and API capabilities, architecture management, increased automation, and comprehensive support for both Node.js and .NET applications.
- The Enterprise Edition is partly open-source, partly source available, and partly Amplication proprietary and not source-available. The idea is to keep the Amplication business while doing the maximum for the community and our loved developers.

## Amplication's Commitment to Open Source

Amplication remains deeply committed to the open-source community. As we expand our offerings with the Enterprise Edition, we make sure to align our development practices and commercial solutions with the values of our open-source projects.
