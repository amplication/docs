# React Todos

Welcome to this tutorial on how to build a full-stack application with Amplication.

This guide assumes that you have, at minimum, a working understanding of the following:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- An IDE

As well as having, at minimum, a basic understanding of the following:

- REST APIs
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

You'll also need an Amplication account, [visit here](https://app.amplication.com/login) to create one.

What we will do is go step by step to create a `Todos` application using React for your frontend and Amplication for your backend.

If you get stuck, have any questions, or just want to say hi to other Amplication developers like yourself, then you should join our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/KSJCZ24vj2)!
