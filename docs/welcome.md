# Amplication Documentation

---

Amplication is an open‑source development tool. It helps professional Node.js developers to develop quality Node.js applications without spending time on repetitive coding tasks.

Amplication auto-generates fully functional apps based on TypeScript and Node.js.

You can see an example of an app generated with Amplication in this repository

It’s quite simple: The developer easily creates data models, and easily configures role-based access control using an intuitive and beautiful UI, and Amplication auto-generates a server-side app based on TypeScript and Node.js and a client app with React.
Generated apps include NestJS, Prisma, REST API, GraphQL API, a React admin UI, authentication, authorization, and logging.

1. Easily create data models, and role-based access control and let Amplication generate your application.
2. Instantly download the source code of your application or push a new Pull Request to a GitHub repository.
3. Keep developing your application with your coding skills and come back to Amplication at any time to add models and roles and generate new versions.
4. Optionally, download or build a Docker container with your database, a Node.js application, and a React client and continuously deploy your application to the cloud or your local environment.

Applications created with Amplication comprise two main components — the server that runs the API and a database.
