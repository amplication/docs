# Amplication Documentation

Amplication helps you build, maintain, and scale backend services that align with your organization's best practices, supporting you throughout the entire development process.
Our platform combines live templates, AI-powered code generation, and technical debt management features to help teams create production-ready Node.js and .NET backend services while enforcing organizational standards.

## Quickstart

[Create your first service](/first-service/) with Amplication's AI, Jovu, and generate a .NET or Node.js _production-ready codebase in minutes_.

## AI-powered Backend Generation

Our AI assistant Jovu helps you rapidly generate production-ready backend services with built-in best practices. Generate complete service infrastructure including REST and GraphQL APIs, database models, authentication, and logging in minutes. Customize your services through our platform's intuitive interface while maintaining consistent architecture patterns and organizational standards.

- **[Jovu](/amplication-ai/)**: Generate production-ready .NET or Node.js code, get intelligent suggestions for your service's architecture, and more with Amplication AI.
- **[Full Stack Code Generation](/getting-started/)**: Fully-functional REST and GraphQL APIs, database models, authentication, logging, React Admin UI, and more.
- [Set up Entities and Fields](/set-up-entities)
- [Configure API Endpoints](/custom-types-and-actions)
- [Add Authentication and Authorization](/configure-roles-and-permissions)

## Embed Your Organization's Best Practices

Define and maintain standardized service architectures through live templates and private plugins.
Create template with pre-configured settings, code generator versions, and plugins.

- [Live Service Templates](/live-service-templates)
- **[Private Plugins](/getting-started/plugins/)**: Extend functionality with private plugins or use our community plugins.
- [Platform Console](/platform-console)

## Technical Debt Prevention

Track and manage technical debt through our Platform Console and Service Catalog.
Monitor template versions, plugin updates, and dependency changes across all services.
Receive automatic notifications when updates are available and get clear upgrade paths for outdated services.
Maintain consistent standards across your entire service portfolio.

- Technical Debt Management
- Service Catalog
- **[Seamless Git Integration](/smart-git-sync/)**: Smart git sync with GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab, or AWS CodeCommit.
- **[Break Your Monolith](/concepts/event-driven-architecture/)**: Create new services with a modern architecture or modernize your existing apps into a event-driven microservices architecture.

## Developer Self-Service

Enable developers to quickly create standardized services through our Service Catalog.
Import existing databases, extend functionality through custom code, leverage multiple database options, and create custom plugins.
With extensive documentation, developers can focus on business logic while maintaining alignment with organizational standards.

- [Service Catalog](/service-catalog)
- **[Import Your Existing DB](/how-to/import-prisma-schema/)**: Use your _existing_ databases for a head start on development.
- **[Custom Code Integration](/custom-code/)**: Extend generated code with your own custom business logic.
- **[Database Support](/getting-started/#databases)**: Support for PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, MS SQL Server, and more.
- **Deployment & CI/CD**: Simplify and automate your CI/CD pipeline with our plugins and streamline deployments to popular options like [AWS ECS](/deploy/aws/ecs), [Docker Desktop](/deploy/docker-desktop/), and [Kubernetes](/deploy/kubernetes).
