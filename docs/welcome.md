# Get Started with Amplication

Hello and welcome to Amplication's developer documentation.

[Amplication](/about/) is an open-source backend development tool. It accelerates the development of Node.js applications by auto-generating production-ready backends.

Streamline your development process and increase productivity so you can focus on what matters most: **creating awesome applications**.

## Quick Start

[Create your first service](/first-service/) with Amplication.
Set up a new service in less than 1 minute with our onboarding wizard.

## Key Features of Amplication

Amplication helps you build a fully functional backend in minutes. Just define your [data models](/how-to/create-entity/), roles, and [permissions](/how-to/set-access-permissions/) — and Amplication will generate a Node.js application with everything you need.

All generated Node.js applications include the following features:

- Fully-functional [REST](/api/#rest-api) and [GraphQL](/api/#graphql-api) APIs for all your data models.
- [Authentication](/authentication/) & Authorization
- React Admin UI
- Logging
- [Smart Git Sync](/smart-git-sync/)
- [Code Generation](/getting-started/view-generated-code/)
- [Deploy](/deploy/) & Publish

In addition, developers can utilize their skills to [customize the generated application](/how-to/custom-code/) afterwards.
