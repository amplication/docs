# Amplication Documentation

Amplication helps you scaffold, build, maintain, and scale backend services that align with your organization's best practices, supporting you throughout the entire development process.

Our platform combines live templates, AI-powered code generation, and proactive technical debt management to help teams quickly scaffold, create, maintain, and scale production-ready Node.js and .NET backend services while continuously enforcing organizational standards.

## Quickstart

[Create your first service](/first-service/) with Amplication's AI, Jovu, and generate a .NET or Node.js _production-ready codebase in minutes_.

## Embed Your Organization's Best Practices

Define and maintain standardized development practices through live templates and private plugins, including code conventions, tools, architecture patterns and more.
Create templates with pre-configured settings, code generator version, and plugins. When templates or plugins are updated, these changes are automatically proposed as pull requests to all dependent services, ensuring your standards continuously evolve across your entire service portfolio.

- **Live Service Templates**: Create and maintain standardized service architectures that automatically propagate best practices
- **[Plugins](/getting-started/plugins/)**: Extend service functionality using community plugins or [private plugins](/enterprise/private-plugins) for security, deployment, monitoring and more
- [**Platform Console**](/platform-console): Centrally manage service standards and configurations

## Technical Debt Prevention

Track and manage technical debt through our [Platform Console](/platform-console) and Service Catalog.
Monitor template versions, plugin updates, and dependency changes across all services.
Receive automatic notifications when updates are available and get clear upgrade paths for outdated services.
Maintain consistent standards across your entire service portfolio, with all changes tracked through version control.

## AI-powered Backend Generation

Our AI assistant, Jovu, helps you rapidly generate production-ready backend services with built-in best practices. Generate complete service infrastructure including REST and GraphQL APIs, database models, authentication, and logging in minutes. Customize your services through our platform's intuitive interface while maintaining consistent standards.

- **[Jovu](/amplication-ai/)**: Generate production-ready .NET or Node.js code, get intelligent suggestions for your service's architecture, and more with Amplication AI.
- **[Full Stack Code Generation](/getting-started/)**: Fully-functional REST and GraphQL APIs, database models, authentication, logging, React Admin UI, and more.
- [Set up Entities and Fields](/set-up-entities)
