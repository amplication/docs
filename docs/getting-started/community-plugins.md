### Mongo DB

Use a Mongo database in your service generated by Amplication.

[MongoDB](https://github.com/amplication/plugins/tree/master/plugins/db-mongo) is a free and open-source cross-platform document-oriented database program. It is classified as a NoSQL database program, meaning that it does not use the traditional SQL relational database management system. Instead, it uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas to store data.

### PostgreSQL DB

Use a PostgreSQL database in your service generated by Amplication.

[PostgreSQL](https://github.com/amplication/plugins/tree/master/plugins/db-postgres) is a free and open-source relational database management system that is designed to be highly scalable, reliable, and powerful. It is known for its ability to handle large amounts of data and a high volume of queries.

### MySQL DB

Use a MySQL database in your service generated by Amplication.

[MySQL](https://github.com/amplication/plugins/tree/master/plugins/db-mysql) is an open-source relational database management system that is widely used in web applications and other software platforms. It is known for its reliability, simplicity, and performance. It is a powerful tool for storing and managing data in a structured and organized way.

### Apache Kafka

Use an Apache Kafka message broker to communicate between your services.

[Apache Kafka](https://github.com/amplication/plugins/tree/master/plugins/broker-kafka) is a distributed streaming platform, used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. It is a publish-subscribe messaging system that allows for the creation of high-throughput and low-latency systems.

In the Apache Kafka messaging system, processes known as producers write data to Kafka topics, and processes known as consumers read data from Kafka topics.

### NestJS NATS

Use a NestJS NATS message broker to communicate between your services.

[NATS](https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/nats) is a high performance, low latency messaging system that is lightweight.
It follows a publish-subscribe model like Kafka but is less complex and easier to set up.
NATS is ideal for applications that require real-time messaging but don't need the level of durability and fault-tolerance that Kafka provides.

### JWT Auth Provider

Add JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication and authorization to your service.

[NestJS's Passport based JWT authentication](https://docs.nestjs.com/security/authentication) involves the client sending a request to the server with a user's credentials in the form of a username and password. The server then authenticates the user and issues a JWT if the credentials are valid. This allows the client to authenticate subsequent requests to the server using the JWT.

:::note
The _NestJS Auth Provider_ plugin must also be installed to use the JWT Auth Provider plugin.
:::

### Passport Basic Authentication

[Basic authentication](https://github.com/amplication/plugins/tree/master/plugins/auth-basic) is a simple authentication scheme built into the HTTP protocol that involves sending a request to a server with a user's credentials in the form of a username and password.
