# Sync with Bitbucket

Amplication can push the code of your app to a Bitbucket repository.
It will provide you with full control over your project and will also allow you to easily track the code generated by Amplication.

:::note
Amplication's Sync With Bitbucket feature is **only available for users on an Enterprise plan**.
:::

This page provides you with everything you need to work with Bitbucket.
You'll learn how to do the following:

- [Authorize Bitbucket](#authorize-amplication-to-access-bitbucket)
- [Create a new Bitbucket repository](#create-a-new-bitbucket-repository)
- [Connect to a specific Bitbucket repository](#select-your-repository)
- [Change git providers for a specific service](#change-your-services-connected-git-provider)
- [Create a new pull request for Bitbucket](#create-a-new-pull-request)

Let's dive right in.

## Prerequisites

If you're running Amplication locally, first read [Connect Amplication server to Bitbucket](/running-amplication-platform/connect-server-to-bitbucket/).
You'll learn how to configure the server to work with a new Bitbucket application.

## Authorize Amplication to access BitBucket

First, go to your project's dashboard.
You'll need to go to the _Sync with Git Provider_ page.
There are 3 ways to do this:

1. Click _Sync with git provider_ on the sidebar.
2. Click on the _Sync with git provider_ tile on your project's dashboard.
3. Click _Connect to git_ on the footer at the bottom of the page.

You're now on the _Sync with Git Provider_ page.
Proceed with the following steps to connect a Bitbucket repository to your service:

1. Click on the `Select organization` dropdown.
2. Click on the `Add Organization` button at the bottom of the dropdown.
3. Click on the `Connect` button for Bitbucket that appears in the _Select Git Provider_ modal.

:::important
If you're already connected to Bitbucket, you can either add another Bitbucket organization or select an account you connected to previously.

You can then go to [selecting your repository](#select-your-repository).
:::

You will be redirected to Bitbucket.

![amplication-bitbucket-oauth-consumer](./assets/sync-with-git-provider/amplication-bitbucket-consumer.png)

Once the connection is established, you can either [create a new Bitbucket repository](#creating-a-new-repository-on-bitbucket) to connect with or select an existing one.
Regardless of the option you choose, **you will need to select the Bitbucket workspace**.

If you're creating a new repository, this will be the workspace where your new repository will reside.
If you're connecting to an existing repository, this should be the workspace where your current repository is located.

![select-workspace](./assets/sync-with-git-provider/select-workspace.png)

Now it's time to create a new repository or select an existing one.

## Create a new Bitbucket repository

First, navigate to your Bitbucket account and select the workspace where you'd like the new repository to live.
Once you're in the chosen workspace, click on `Create Repository`.

## Select Your Repository

You'll see a modal appear with a populated list of repositories based on your configuration settings from above.

## Change Your Service's Repository or Git Provider

Each project will have a default repository set when you create the first service.
Every new service you create within this project will inherit the default repo.

But, it's possible to override the default and set a new repo on a service-by-service basis.
There are **two ways** to do this:

1. When creating a new service using the Service Creation Wizard.
You will have the option to turn on the `Override default settings` toggle [during the Git Provider selection step](/first-service/#step-2-connect-your-github-repository).

2. By visiting the service's _Sync With Git Provider_ page.
On this page you can also turn on the `Override default settings` toggle and change the target repo for the service.

You will be able to connect a new git provider, like [GitHub](/sync-with-github) or another Bitbucket account.

After selecting the git provider and organization you want to proceed with, the  [repository selection modal](#select-your-repository) will appear again.
You can now select a new repository for this specific service.

## Create a New Pull Request 

First, make changes to your service.

:::important
Follow our [Building New Versions of Your Service](/building-new-versions) guide to go through the steps of changing and making additions to your service.
:::

After making changes to your service, navigate to the Pending Changes section in the right sidebar. Write a commit message and click on `Commit Changes & Build`.

This will take you to the commits page.
Here you can select the service for which you wish to view the build log.
Once the build process is completed, you can open the pull request generated by Amplication within Bitbucket.
You can do this by clicking either on the footer or on the "Push Changes to Bitbucket" action step.

![push-to-bitbucket-build](./assets/sync-with-git-provider/push-to-bitbucket.png)

And there you have it â€“ a new pull request ready for review.

![bitbucket-pull-request](./assets/sync-with-git-provider/bitbucket-pull-request.png)

## Merging Amplication's Pull Request into your branch

Amplication creates pull requests from the `amplication` branch into your repository's default base branch.
Amplication triggers the creation of a commit on the changed files whenever a new build is performed on a project.
The changed files are all the files that were added, removed, or changed from the last build.

:::note
**Do not delete the `amplication` branch**.

Do not modify the `amplication` branch, except to resolve conflicts. Handle conflicts directly on the `amplication` branch. Avoid creating new commits or merging changes from other branches to prevent bugs and inconsistencies.
